Welcome to the Truss Solver. This is an application 
that simulates 2D trusses and solve for internal 
forces. 

New Features v1.0.4:
Solving Support Reactions feature is officially 
implemented!
The following limitations apply:
1) There can be only 1 pin and 1 roller support 
(otherwise the support reaction will not be solvable 
by our standard).
2) The support reactions will only be taken into 
consideration when they BOTH exists.
