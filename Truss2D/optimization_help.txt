[Optimization Mode]
Optimization mode provides ways to optimize a truss. 
To enter optimization mode, type 'beast-mode', and 
press Enter.

Unlike regular truss calculator, optimization mode
does not account for bad truss buildings (e.g. 
extra joints, overlapping joints, etc.), make sure
that the truss works in Regular Mode before 
proceeding to use optimization mode. It is 
recommended that you write the commands in a text 
file, save the file and paste it to the 
optimization mode (or an empty console app).

Here are a few core commands of the Optimization
Mode:
'add': same as in regular mode.
'link': same as in regular mode.
'exert': same as in regular mode.
'optimize': starts optimization.
	'optimize tri 3': starts level 3 triangular optimization.
	'optimize tetra 4': starts level 4 tetrahedral optimization.
	'optimize hex 2': starts level 2 hexagonal optimization.
	'optimize oct 5': starts level 5 octagonal optimization.
	Optimization Level see Appendix ...
'newcoord': see all new coordinates after optimization.
'cost': see current cost.
'works': see if the current truss works or not.

Optimization level are listed below:
	Level 1: 1
	Level 2: 0.5
	Level 3: 0.2
	Level 4: 0.1
	Level 5: 0.05
	Level 6: 0.02
	Level 7: 0.01
